This assignment was completed for Visual Interfaces to Computers offered at
Columbia University in the spring of 2015.

The goal of this assignment is to compare images to one another based on color
and texture.  Specifically, the program's goal is to determine which images are
the most and least similar to one another in each of these categories.  It
continues this goal by then trying to group images based on a combination of
both of these attributes.

The 40 images used for the assignment are not included as I do not have the
rights to distribute them. They were primarily images of fruits and vegatables
that were 60 x 89 pixels in size.
